  <h1>window</h1>
  <p>Outside the window, darkness stretches endlessly, a deep black that swallows every shape.<br>
Only the cicadas stir the air with their faint, <br>
restless chorus; everything else seems to hold its breath in silent stillness.<br>
Inside, what was once noisy and chaotic now lies in shadows draped across the floor.<br>
The room breathes quietly, as if only hollow echoes remain.</p>
